    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, 
        made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to 
        an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating 
        with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), 
        vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, 
        and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian 
        seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may 
        be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. 
        Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients 
        and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into 
        single-serving square portions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot cook lasagna noodles in boiling salted water 
            until al dente. Rinse with cool water. Drain.</li>
        <li>In large sauce pan cook ground beef. Drain excess grease. 
            Combine tomato sauces and tomato paste with ground beef and
